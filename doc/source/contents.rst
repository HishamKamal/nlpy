   Introduction <introduction>


Some pages of this documentation display equations via the `jsMath
<http://www.math.union.edu/~dpvc/jsMath/welcome.html>`_ package. They should
look reasonably good with most setups but the best rendering is obtained by
installing the TeX fonts. Please refer to
`http://www.math.union.edu/~dpvc/jsMath/users/welcome.html
