.. warning::

   Much remains to be done in terms of documentation. For now, the paper and
   inline documentation are all there is. With time, these pages will grow.
   Inline documentation is reproduced below in much more readable form. Please
   alert me of all errors or insufficient documentation strings.

Some pages of this documentation display equations via the `jsMath
<http://www.math.union.edu/~dpvc/jsMath/welcome.html>`_ package. They should
look reasonably good with most setups but the best rendering is obtained by
installing the TeX fonts. Please refer to
`http://www.math.union.edu/~dpvc/jsMath/users/welcome.html
