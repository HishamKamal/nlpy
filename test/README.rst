=======================
Running NLPy Unit Tests
=======================

Unit tests are still in an embryonic state but the plan is to write tests to
exercise as many features of NLPy as possible. You will need `nose
<http://somethingaboutorange.com/mrl/projects/nose>`_ to run the unit tests.

From the top-level NLPy directory, run::

    nosetests test
